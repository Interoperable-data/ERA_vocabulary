# ERA SHACL Shapes

This is the repository where the SHACL shapes that are presented as part of the documentation of the ERA vocabulary are maintained. 

The development of these SHACL shapes is being done in a separate [repository](https://git.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/datateam/ERA/era-dataset-manager-shacl-validation-daemon/-/tree/dev?ref_type=heads). Specifically, the shapes that are currently used in the validation process are those contained in the [shapes-property](https://git.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/datateam/ERA/era-dataset-manager-shacl-validation-daemon/-/tree/dev/shapes-property?ref_type=heads) folder

Therefore, whenever there are changes in that repository, those changes should be copied into this folder and the documentation of the ontology should be regenerated.
