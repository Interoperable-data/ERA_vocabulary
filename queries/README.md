# ERA ontology queries

The queries contained in this folder correspond to a catalogue of SPARQL queries (together with their correspondence in natural language) that can be useful for different purposes and that can be executed in the [Data Stories](https://data-interop.era.europa.eu/data-stories) option within the Register of Infrastructure (RINF) System. 

Queries are provided as independent files inside this folder to facilitate the generation of references to them from other parts of the ERA ecosystem (e.g., ontology documentation, demo sites, etc.), especially in case of ontology changes. 

The development of these queries is being done in this [repository](https://git.fpfis.tech.ec.europa.eu/datateam/ERA/era-landing/-/tree/dev/src/components/DataStories/queries?ref_type=heads).
